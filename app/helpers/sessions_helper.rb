    # sessions_helper, rather than any database model; they pertain to what's going on in a person's browser]), otherwise 
    # sets current_user to the user associated with the cookie (if someone has signed in, closed the browser, but hasn't 
    # signed out yet) -- THIS IS PROBABLY NOT RIGHT - it just hits the find_by the first time current_user is used 
# for a request, and then any further times... 
# TRY AGAIN:  I think this is a getter method.  It sets @current_user to it's existing values is defined, otherwise
# it finds_by.  It sets @current_user in either case.
