			<div class="span6 offset1"><h4>Praveen R. Shanbhag, <em>Founding Member & CEO</em></h4>Praveen is a PhD candidate in Philosophy at Stanford University, and holds a BA from Harvard University, an MA from Columbia University, and an MPhil from the University of Cambridge, in a variety of fields. Like all philosophically-trained individuals, he likes asking unusual questions, and one was: 'if we all know (as Dale Carnegie says) that the sweetest sound to a person is their name, why are names so often mispronounced even at critical moments in our lives?' With the help of many amazingly-talented people, he founded VoiceGems to provide an answer. He also loves new challenges, which at the moment means learning to windsurf (or at least learning to not fall off the board.)</div>

He has also received an MS in Statistics from Stanford in addition to a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As one might imagine, Praveen Bommannavar has had his name consistently mispronounced during all of these ceremonies, and in many places besides! Praveen has worked on interesting data mining problems at a number of tech companies including Twitter, LinkedIn and Klout and has been a consultant for @WalmartLabs. He has also been involved in a few other projects he is passionate about, the latest being VoiceGems, and is excited to be part of the solution to name mispronunciation! </div>
