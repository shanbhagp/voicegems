    		NameCoach was founded in 2012, with the mission to solve a problem we are all too familiar with: name mispronunciation in important life settings. Especially with increasing diversity, it has become common to be careless with this fundamental aspect of human communication - our names are an important part of our identity, and a person's name carries special meaning both for that individual and for others. NameCoach provides a simple and effective approach to addressing this problem, allowing individuals to voice-record their names so others can easily hear and know how to say their names correctly.

          <h4>Praveen R. Shanbhag, <em>Founding Member & CEO</em></h4>Praveen is a PhD candidate in Philosophy at Stanford University, and holds a BA from Harvard University, an MA from Columbia University, and an MPhil from the University of Cambridge, in various fields. Like all philosophically-trained individuals, he likes asking unusual questions, and one was: 'if we all know that (as Dale Carnegie says) the sweetest sound to a person is their own name, why are names so often mispronounced even at critical moments in our lives?' With the help of many amazingly-talented people, he founded NameCoach to provide an answer. He also loves new challenges, which at the moment means learning to windsurf and sail (or at least learning to not fall off the board or boat.)

He has also received an MS in Statistics from Stanford in addition to a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

He has also been involved in a few other projects he is passionate about, the latest being NameCoach, and is excited to be part of the solution to name mispronunciation!
