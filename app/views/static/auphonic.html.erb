				<h2 class="blue">Delivering Polished VoiceGems</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>A key benefit of VoiceGems is its ease of use and accessibility: anyone can record personal messages from the privacy and comfort of their own laptops or mobile phones. But there can be a trade-off for convenience: latops and mobile phones aren't professional recording devices, which means that quality could be compromised.</p> <p> VoiceGems solves this problem by using cutting-edge audio processors to clean up user recordings.</p>
				<br/>

				<h3 class="blue">Automatic Cloud-based Audio Processing</h3>
				<br/>

				<p>VoiceGems is now fully integrated with Auphonic's cutting-edge cloud-based audio processing system.  Every recording is automatically treated with the following audio algorithms:</p>
			
				<ul>

				<li><h4 class="blue">Noise and Hiss Reduction Algorithm</h4></li>
				<h5>Broadband background noise and hiss (often found in laptop mics) are removed from the audio signal.</h5>
			

				<li><h4 class="blue">Hum Reduction Algorithm</h4></li>
				<h5>Power hum and partials are removed from the audio signal.</h5>
			

				<li><h4 class="blue">Global Loudness Normalization and True Peak Limiter</h4></li>
				<h5>All processed files have the same average loudness. The default target is set to -16 LUFS.</h5>

				</ul>
