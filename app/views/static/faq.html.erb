					<div class="panel-body">
						Yes. If fact, our entire site uses up-to-date SSL Encryption (indicated by the padlock icon and https:// prefix in your browser's address bar).
						This means that not only payment information, but all user information, is securely handled.
						As an added layer of security, we use the Stripe payment gateway, and strictly comply with their payment processing protocol.
						This means that encrypted payment information (such as credit card numbers) never touch our database,
						but are instead immediately transmitted to Stripe's industry-standard secure processing system.
