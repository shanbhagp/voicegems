                      <ol>

                        <li> Enter their email and click 'Invite Admin' </li>

                    </p>
                    <p> People can also view a 'read-only' version of your Event Page, from which they can hear name recordings. The link to this 'read-only' verion is available on your Event Page - just give it to whomever needs to learn the names.

                      <p>Similar services charge up to $300 for just one event.  While many institutions are willing to budget those line-items for important purposes, we keep costs low by adhering to the philosophy that simpler works better here. </p>

                       <p>For example, we don't use text-to-voice or voice-to-text algorithms - the entire point of getting the name right is to directly hear, and reproduce, how the individual says their name, without the mediation of a synthesized voice that inevitably won't faithfully reproduce all pronunciations anyway! </p>

                       <p>Instead, we use ubiquitously-recognized and fully web-based audio-recording and playback technology (rather than a more complicated telecom system). So once more, simple = most cost-effective and high-fidelity. </p>

                       <p>Similarly, allowing the announcers to enter their own phonetic spellings/notes, if they desire, allows them to reproduce and recall the recorded pronunciations in whatever way is easiest for them. </p>

                       <p>In sum, our unique solution to the pronunciation problem is at once the most user-friendly, cost-effective, and hi-fidelity!</p>
