                            <br/><strong>Often it's a matter of identity.</strong> One of our finest and best-known students surprised me with the revelation that she had stoically endured the mispronunciation of her name through four honor-filled years. Yet, because her French-Canadian roots were so meaningful to her, she appreciated being asked about her name so that her identity might be properly expressed as she walked across the platform.<br/>
                            <br/>That example could be multiplied many times. <strong>So I e-mail students and faculty, request voicemails, check with advisers, corner folks in the dining hall.</strong> I make phonetic notes on alphabetical lists of possible attendees and transpose them to the "walker" cards that students hand me before crossing the stage. <strong>Technology? Using it will have to await a future year. Right now the task is to try and get it right for the moment.</strong><br/>
                            <br/><strong>No doubt, many of you who are reading this take similar pains.</strong> The reason is not because it matters in some ultimate existential or intellectual sense, or because it is part of our job descriptions. We do so, rather, because what matters is to model <strong>painstaking preparation and hard work</strong> to our students and <strong>to make the academic ritual special for them and their families.</strong>
