	  <p>In some cases, it's nearly impossible to learn how to pronounce a name any other way.</p>  
 
  	  <p>With <em>VoiceGems</em>, we are no longer limited to:</p>

      <br/>
      <p> Recent surveys conclude that 72% of all brides say they would have spent more time choosing their reception entertainment, and within one week of the reception, 78% of brides say they would have made this their top priority.*  <strong>Dissatisfied clients mean fewer glowing reviews and referrals.</strong>  And one of the big issues is whether the names were announced correctly - understandably, no client wants their names, or the names of their family and friends, publicly mispronounced on the most important day of their lives!</p>

  			<blockquote><em>"...the  selection of a DJ will be among your most important decisions.  The best DJ’s will not only meet with you ahead of time to go over your music choices and how the reception should flow, but will then also actually deliver what you ordered. <strong>Too many DJ’s</strong> (and some bands) dress inappropriately, ignore your song requests, <strong>mispronounce names during the introductions</strong> or blast the music so loud that half of your guests will be congregating outside the ballroom to escape the volume."</em></blockquote>
