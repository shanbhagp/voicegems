<h3>VoiceGems PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<hr/>


<h4>INTRODUCTION </h4>

<p>At VoiceGems, we are dedicated to providing you with a safe and secure user experience while protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal information. Below are our principles established to ensure the confidentiality, accuracy and security of your personal information. The principles contained herein relate to the collection, use, disclosure, accuracy and retention of personal information in our care and control.</p>

<h4>Website Visitors</h4>

<p> Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.  Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use the Website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate – for example, by publishing a report on usage trends on the Website.</p>

<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

<p>Personally-identifying information is any information about you that is personally identifiable to you, including your name, address, e‐mail address, telephone number, age, gender as well as other non‐public information associated with the foregoing. We collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the Website and Services. </p>


<p>We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Services or other website-related activities.</p>

<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

<p>We may use personally-identifying information for our own internal purposes, including, but not limited to, processing your registration, providing you with information and contacting you via phone or e‐mail. We reserve the right to disclose personally-identifying information where such disclosure is required by law, considered necessary to prevent or investigate an apparent breach of law, and/or in any other instance where the applicable privacy or other legislation permits such disclosure.</p>

<p>We do not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. 
</p>

<h4>SECURITY</h4>

<p>As we are committed to protecting the security of your Information, we employ a number of security information technologies and procedures designed to help protect your Information from unauthorized access, use and/or disclosure. We will retain your Information for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires. While we endeavour to limit access to your Information, we are not responsible for the retention or use of Information obtained by other third parties who have gained access to our database.</p>
